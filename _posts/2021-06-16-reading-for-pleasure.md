## Leisure

> What is this life if, full of care,
> We have no time to stand and stare.
>
> No time to stand beneath the boughs
> And stare as long as sheep or cows.
>
> No time to see, when woods we pass,
> Where squirrels hides their nuts in the grass.
>
> No time to see, in broad daylight,
> Streams full of stars like skies at night.
>
> No time to turn at Beauty’s glance,
> And watch her feet, how they can dance.
>
> No time to wait till her mouth can
> Enrich that smile her eyes began.
>
> A poor life this is if, full of care,
> We have no time to stand and stare.
>
> ***W. H. Davies***

Have you found the poet’s answer to the question? If so, do you agree with him?

What does the poet see in the streams? Are they really full of stars?

Why do you think Beauty is spelt with a capital B?

Who does ‘her’ refer to? Who is smiling?

What do you like to think of when you ‘stand and stare’?

What other words could you substitute for this expression, supposing it is not to be taken literally.
