**OUR SCHOOL**
Our aim is to prepare students for life, with all its challenges, like we have seen over the past two years due to the Coronavirus pandemic, which undoubtedly has hit us all and affected our lives, and to help them develop an informed curiosity and lifelong passion for learning and for making the world a better place. 

Currently we offer three different routes for students to choose from: Bilingual Humanities, Natural Sciences and Economy, (these last two dictated in Spanish). 

After working hard for many years, in 2006 we decided to take on another challenge and offer a new opportunity to our students. 

We became AR 819, a Cambridge Centre and Cambridge school in Río Grande, Tierra del Fuego. This means we belong to programs established by the University of Cambridge. Within this organisation, Cambridge Assessment has developed and promoted qualifications around the world for almost 150 years. In 1998 Cambridge International Examinations (CIE) was formally established to provide high quality, leading-edge qualifications that meet the ongoing demands of employers and educators across the world.

“Within all the abilities and skills, we wish to offer to our students in order to help them face the world, we consider that the knowledge of the English language is a skill that can be acquired and perfected with dedication and effort. Globalization has made the knowledge of a language such as English become a tool of great importance. This will allow and facilitate the student’s communication in the future. Wanting to be part of this global world, is an incentive and now more and more people want to dominate this skill”. Guillermo Pazos, Bilingual Coordinator and Head of Centre. 

**IGCSE exams** 
We are very proud to be part of this, and we train our students to sit for the Cambridge IGCSE exams, (International General Certificate of Secondary Education. This curriculum offers a variety of topics as well as a wide range of abilities. 
We have built our curriculum together with the Spanish side and meeting the requirements of the National curriculum. We work towards reaching the following objectives: to develop the learner’s knowledge, understanding and skills in subject content, applying knowledge and understanding to new as well as unfamiliar situations, intellectual enquiry, flexibility and responsiveness to change, working and communicating in English, influencing outcomes and cultural awareness.
Students sit for 7 international exams, in 4th and 5th years. At the moment these subjects are English as A Second Language, World Literature, Biology, History, Maths, Information and Communication Technology; and First Language Spanish. When the students have succeeded in these 7 subjects, they obtain the ICE (International Certificate of Education). 

**AS and A LEVELS**

We also work closely with all the team of teachers in order to help prepare our learners in the last years of school for university study. Many universities worldwide value and recognise Cambridge International AS and A Level qualifications. These exams are pre-university level, and introduce students to the next stage of their education.  These exams take place in 6th year. The main focus of these subjects is to develop learners’ knowledge, understanding and skills in: in-depth subject content, Independent thinking, applying knowledge and understanding to new as well as familiar situations, handling and evaluating different types of information source, thinking logically and presenting ordered and coherent arguments, making judgements, recommendations and decisions,  presenting reasoned explanations, understanding implications and communicating them logically and clearly, and working and communicating in English.

The subjects that we offer at CIERG at AS and A level are: Thinking Skills, Psychology, English General Paper, Economics, Spanish and Global Perspectives. 

**CAMBRIDGE ENGLISH** 
We are also pleased to communicate that we are working in order to be recognised as a Cambridge English Centre as from 2022, for the world’s leading range of certificates for learners of English. This will enable us to offer a wide range of English language exams such as: Pre-A1 Starters, A1 Movers, A2 Flyers, A2 Key for Schools, B1 PET for schools, B2 FCE for schools, C1 Advanced and C2 Proficiency. 

We offer these exams to our students who do not do the Bilingual Humanities Secondary but have chosen Natural Sciences or Economy. They study English as a Foreign Language as a subject and can sit for these exams. Besides this, they can also choose to sit for Biology IGCSE or Business IGCSE according to the route they have chosen. 

Also, once we have obtained recognition as a Cambridge English Centre, we will be able to offer these English Language exams to EADEB school, and also to UTN and ISPRG university students. 

Throughout all these years we have obviously undergone challenging times; sometimes it is difficult to access materials; other times it is difficult to train teachers in specific areas of knowledge, but on the whole we have been able to manage the situation. 

We have also had very good experiences, and fulfilling moments, such as when one our former students won a Top of the World Achievement in Literature.  Also, a couple of years ago one of our 6th year students was awarded a High Achievement in English General Paper in the A levels exams. 

But above all, our greatest satisfaction is to see our students become fluent speakers, and critical thinkers, that are able to apply not only their knowledge, but also their skills and abilities acquired to solve problems and make decisions in this ever challenging and changing world.
